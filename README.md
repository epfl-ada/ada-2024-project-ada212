# From Page to Screen ‚Äì The Journey and Success of Book Adaptations

Team : Ghalia, Rania, Valentin, Omar and Le√Øla 

# Abstract
This project explores the impact of book adaptations on a movie‚Äôs success, examining which factors contribute to their financial and critical outcomes. By leveraging the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, enriched with metadata from IMDb and Wikidata, the research investigates whether being adapted from a book, including genre and source type (single novel or series), correlates with box office revenue and audience reception. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in adaptation strategies, comparing profitability across different genres and production scales. This study not only highlights the key elements behind the successful transition from page to screen but also offers insights into broader audience preferences and the storytelling elements that resonate with viewers.


# Research Questions
## Storytelling Framework
The analysis is framed around the storytelling theme. This narrative guides us through the following research questions, building a cohesive story that contrasts book adaptations and original movies.

1. **The Origins: What Books Capture the Attention of Filmmakers?**
   - What traits in books make them attractive for adaptation?

2. **The Path to Adaptation: What Factors Influence Adaptation Time?**
   - How long does it take for a popular book to become a movie, and what influences this timeline?
   - Are there seasonal patterns in the release of book adaptations?

3. **The Grand Premiere: Measuring the Success of Adaptations**
   - What elements predict the success of a movie adaptation?
   - How has the popularity and financial success of book adaptations evolved over time?

4. **The Global Reception: Do Adaptations Translate Well Across Borders?**
   - How do movie adaptations perform internationally, and are adaptations from certain countries more successful?
   - Are adaptations from certain countries more successful, and do they align with the nationality of the book's author?

5. **The Budget and Investment Dilemma: Does Spending More Pay Off?**
   - Is there a direct correlation between the budget of an adaptation and its financial and critical success?

6. **Plot Twist: Unexpected Success Stories**
   - Which book adaptations outperformed expectations despite low initial ratings or budgets?

# Data
- **Base Dataset**: The primary dataset, the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, contains information on approximately 80,000 films, including details like release dates, duration, genre, and cast. For this study, we augmented this dataset with data from several additional sources.
- **Additional Datasets**:
   - **IMDb Ratings:** To measure audience reception, we enhanced our dataset with IMDb scores.
   - **TMDB:** Many entries in the CMU dataset lacked revenue information. We filled these gaps using data from The Movie Database (TMDB).
   - **Wikidata:** We fetched some more data about movies' revenue and budget from Wikidata. Moreover, to identify films that are based on books, we queried the Wikidata Graph Database with SPARQL. We also obtained metadata about these books, such as publication dates, page count, genre, and author, enabling comparisons between the books' characteristics and those of their corresponding films.
   - **Goodreads:** To further enrich our book data, we incorporated information scraped from Goodreads, including user ratings and page counts for each book.
   - **Consumer Price Index (CPI):** Since our revenue and budget data spans multiple decades, we used the U.S. Consumer Price Index to normalize financial data, making revenue and budget figures comparable over time.
- **Data extraction and first preprocessing:**: In the notebook data_extraction.ipynb, we loaded, preprocessed, and combined these datasets.
   - **How to merge ?** 
      - CMU-Wikidata Link: Each movie in the CMU dataset has a unique Wikipedia ID, which does not match the corresponding Wikidata IDs. We used the wikimapper package to align Wikidata and Wikipedia IDs accurately.
      - Wikidata-IMDb-TMDB Link: Since Wikidata includes IMDb IDs for most movies, we leveraged these identifiers to link records across the IMDb and TMDB datasets.
      - Wikidata-Goodreads Link: Merging book data from Wikidata with Goodreads posed difficulties due to inconsistent Goodreads IDs in Wikidata. Instead, we matched the records using a combination of (book_author, book_title), assuming this pair would uniquely identify most books.
   - **First Preprocessing:**
      - We standardized title and author formats across datasets.
      - We fetched the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and computed the inflation adjustment factor for each year so we can later on normalize financial data.
- **Final Dataset:**  data_extraction.ipynb notebook creates 3 .csv files:
   - book_adapation.csv which contains metadata for movies and metadata for books for which movies were identified as adaptations from Wikidata.
   - inflation_adjustment.csv which contains the inflation adjustment rate for multiple years, it will be used later in the results.ipynb to normalize budgets and revenues.
   - book_adapation_extanded.csv which contains some late fetched revenue and budget infomations from Wikidata.

# Methods 
In order to find answers to these questions, we will use the following data analysis pipeline.

## Part 0 : Creating dataset and cleaning the data
- **Approach**:
  - Remove duplicates and handle missing values appropriately.
  - Clean categorical variables (e.g., genres, languages) and standardize numerical data (e.g., revenue, budget) for analysis.
  - Normalize or transform data as needed (e.g., log transformations for skewed distributions).
    
## Part 1 : Looking for similarities between adapted books
- Step 1 : Use correlation analysis to identify book features (e.g., ratings, page count) that correlate with being chosen for adaptation
- Step 2 : Use a Random Forest Regressor to determine which features of the book (e.g., page count, genre, ratings) are most important in predicting movie success.
- Step 3 : Implement a logistic regression to predict whether a book will result in a successful movie adaptation (using a threshold, such as revenue above a median value or IMDb rating above a certain score).

## Part 2 : Analyzing Adaptation Timelines and Release Patterns
- Step 1 : **Kaplan-Meier Estimators**: Visualize the ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù rate of books over time, showing the likelihood of adaptation within different time frames.
- Step 2: **Seasonal Analysis**: Analyze the release patterns of adaptations to identify if certain seasons align with higher success rates using time series plots.

## Part 3 : Results of book-to-movie transformation
- Step 1 : Model the relationship between book characteristics (e.g., genre, ratings) and movie success metrics (e.g., box office revenue, IMDb rating). For instance, using correlational analysis between Goodreads ratings and movie performance metrics.
- Step 2 : Compare movie adaptations with original movies to see which type tends to perform better.

## Part 4 : International renown of adaptations 
- Step 1 : Create maps showing the performance of adaptations by country.
- Step 2 : Use audience review data to assess how adaptations are received in different parts of the world.

## Part 5 : Focusing on budget allocated to adaptations
- Step 1 : Use scatter plots and regression models to show if a larger budget leads to higher revenue and better ratings.
- Step 2 : Calculate ROI and visualize the distribution to identify budget ‚Äúsweet spots‚Äù where adaptations achieve the best returns.

## Part 6 : Plot twist: unexpected story successes
- Identify outliers‚Äîbook adaptations that surpassed expectations despite low initial ratings or budgets‚Äîand analyze their attributes to uncover common factors contributing to their success.
