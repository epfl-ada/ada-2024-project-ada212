Judas, eager for revenge, plans to substitute her baby for the Courtland infant, confident that she can carry out her scheme as the babies bear a striking resemblance to each other. The change of babies is successfully made. A few years elapse and Pearl, Byke's daughter is raised as Courtland's, while Laura, the Courtland child, is brought up as Byke's daughter and taught to steal. Laura is caught stealing by her own father and mother, the Courtlands. Laura's tale of how her ""papa"" makes her steal touches the Courtlands and they adopt her (their own child) after making a money settlement with Byke. Laura and Pearl are about 20 when the Courtlands die, leaving their fortune equally divided between the two girls. Pearl is secretly in love with Ray Trafford, Laura's suitor. Byke plans to blackmail Laura and gets Snorky, an ex-soldier to deliver her the following note: ""My darling daughter, I think it's about time you had a talk with me. I am outside waiting to see you. Your own father. Wm. Byke"" Laura faints and Pearl reads the note. Byke enters the house but is thrown out by Ray. Pearl tells Ray Laura's story and hands him the note Ray gives vent to his shocked feelings and Laura interprets his action to mean that he is ashamed of her. Laura takes off her engagement ring and goes to her room. Through the prevarications of Pearl, Laura is led to believe that Ray does not care to see her again, and Ray likewise believes that his dismissal is final. Ray writes Laura that he loves her although her parents are of low origin. Through Pearl's craftiness this note is never delivered to Laura. Byke and Judas attempt to kill Blossom, as she knows the truth about Laura and Pearl, but they are frustrated by Snorky. At the Rensaeller reception, Pearl plans Laura's disgrace. She drops Ray's note to Laura, which is found by Mrs. Rensaeller, whereupon Laura is snubbed by all. Humiliated, Laura goes away, leaving a note saying that her share of the estate goes to Pearl. Ray at once begins a search for Laura and engages Snorky to assist. Byke and Judas, seeking to obtain hush-money from Laura find Laura's note, stating that she leaves her money to Pearl. They discover Laura's lodging-house and abduct her. Laura is taken to Byke's den on the riverfront. Unless Laura agrees to sign over her fortune, her chances of living are dubious. Blossom discovers Laura's plight and notifies Snorky. Through Snorky, Laura is saved, but Snorky is caught by Byke. Snorky, firmly bound to the piling and left to drown by inches, is rescued by Ray and Blossom. Laura, escaping across the river, is found by Snorky. She seeks safety in a tool house by the railroad track. Snorky is again caught by Byke and bound to the track, and left to his fate. Laura, observing, is frantic when she finds the tool house door locked. With the aid of an axe, she breaks open the door and reaches Snorky just in time to save him from certain death, as the train is bearing down upon him. Byke and Judas go to Pearl at the Courtland's summer home and Judas tells Pearl she is her mother. Pearl realizes the bitter truth of her parentage when Blossom confirms Judas' assertion. Pearl upbraids Judas and turns her from the house. Snorky brings Laura to Ray at the Courtland home, where they meet Byke. Snorty shoots Byke, who staggers out and falls dead at the feet of Judas. Judas, widowed and disowned by her daughter, leaves in despair.

She wants some time away to discover whether she should accept his marriage proposal; in doing so, she meets several wannabe-suitors who will enter, leave, and re-enter her life during her young-adulthood. The one she believes that she is truly in love with is Noel Airman, 14 years her senior, who is social director of South Wind, a summer resort in the Catskills, when they first meet.

What those at South Winds do not see is Noel's time away from South Winds; he has a tendency to not finish what he starts, which might be one reason he never sees himself getting married. What Rose might find more egregious about Noel as Marjorie's potential husband is the fact that he turned his back on his Jewish heritage.

The Three Must-Get-Theres,1922.0,6.9,661.0,"Action,Adventure,Comedy","This delightful burlesque of Alexandre Dumas' famous adventure narrative (and then-leading screen swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks' hit films) represented one of writer/director/star Max Linder's attempts to conquer Hollywood on its own turf. He'd been an enormous star in early silent cinema, influencing the style of such subsequent silent comedy luminaries as Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton. But his health suffered after he was gassed fighting for France in World War I. Despite the support of Chaplin himself (among others), his subsequent career in America never reached the popular heights he had at home. The commercial failure of this final U.S. effort seems particularly bewildering now, since THE THREE MUST-GET-THERES holds up so well. This spoof has the antic star as Dart-in-Again, a rapier-wielding dandy with a lovelorn horse (pining for the cow it left behind in the country) and a tendency to make an idiot of himself whilst attempting to conquer the forces of tyranny.

Toon's homecoming is dismal because his wealthy father rejects him on account of his dissolute life. During the absence of Dries, Greet has been courted unsuccessfully by Leendert, the pampered pet of his mother known as Auntie Piet, who runs the local pub. Piet browbeats her husband Gerrit, treats her poor relation Doortje as a drudge and idolizes her wastrel son. Determined that Leendert will marry Greet, Piet whispers in the ear of Betje that Greet is ""indecent"". However, when Betje tells her son Dries, he will not believe such gossip. In the pub one evening, when Leendert importunes Greet, Dries knocks him down. In the ensuing fight a knife is drawn. Policemen intervene and Dries is taken to gaol. Making use of the street-singers Na Druppel and De Mop, Piet spreads the rumor that Greet has been seen dancing with many men. When Dries is released, he asks Greet whether the story is true. She admits that she went to the dance-hall, but is given no chance to explain why. Disillusioned, Dries tells Manus and Toon that he intends to enlist as a colonial soldier. His comrades, equally unhappy in Amsterdam - Manus because of the way Jans treats him, Toon because he cannot find work - agree to join up at the same time. In a melancholy frame of mind the three mates leave for the Dutch East Indies, where they spend the following six years. When their term of service expires, the young men set off for Holland and home. Only two return, as Toon dies on the ship, a victim of his alcoholism and the tropical climate.
